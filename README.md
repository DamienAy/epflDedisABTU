Online real-time collaborative services, such as Google Docs and Etherpad, rise in popularity thanks to their global accessibility and convenience of use. However, the users of such systems have to fully trust service providers for data protection and preserving privacy. Potential serverâ€™s compromise or pressure from state agencies can result into data leakage and fail in this trust.

The goal of this project is to make a step towards a secure real-time peer-to-peer collaboration platform. The high-level task is to study, implement and deploy the state-of-the-art algorithm for decentralized collaborative editing called Admissibility-Based Operational Transformation (ABT). The algorithm extends Operational Transformation (OT) model that is a core building block for most of the collaborative editors.
